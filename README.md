# MovieSafe

You know those movies that you've been meaning to watch for years? If you are anything like me, I was keeping a list on my notes app on my phone. But I knew there could be a better way to keep track. MovieSafe intends to answer this.

MovieSafe is an app designed with React to improve the movie tracking experience. More features are currently in development.

## Features

- Make a list of movies you want to watch
- Automatic in-browser storage
- Clicking on the movie title will take you to the movie's Google page
- Clear watched movies from your list
- Collection page to keep track of watched movies (in development)

## Planned Future Features:

- Syncing between devices
- Incorporate movie recommender system
- Add in a section for each movie's ratings i.e. Rotten Tomatoes, iMDB, etc.

## To run the app:

Download all necessary files and run the launch.bat file.

### Important:

The launch.bat file must match the downloads folder or whichever path the files have been moved to.
