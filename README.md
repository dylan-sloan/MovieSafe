# MovieSafe

You know those movies that you've been meaning to watch for years? If you are anything like me, I was keeping a list on my notes app on my phone. But I knew there could be a better way to keep track. MovieSafe intends to answer this.

MovieSafe is an app designed with React to improve the movie tracking experience. More features are currently in development.
